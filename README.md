# Homework-1
by Julian Secomb

Objective: The objective of this assignment is to improve the code of a Business' existing website in order to make comply with a set of accesibility standards that enable people with disabilities or socio-economic restrictions to have access to their website. This involves modifying the source code to inlcude:
- semantic HTML elements;
- a logical structure to the HTML elements;
- alt attributes for all imageds;
- headings that fall into sequential order; and
- a concise, descriptive title.

In the process of making these changes to the code base we are also tasked with ensuring that links are functioning correctly, cleaning up the CSS to make it more efficient, consolidating CSS selectors and properties, organizing them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements, and including comments before each element or section of the page.

Work Completed: Made changes to the HTML and CSS to satisfy the main requirements set out above. In addition, a broken link was fixed and changes were made to restructure the code more logically and simplify the CSS. This involved reorganizing the CSS to follow the same order as the HTML and consolidating identical CSS selectors and properties. All changes are commented in both the HTML and CSS.
